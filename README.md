# Similar Movies Example

This is a small script to show how to find similar movies using collaborative filters, without any information about content.

The script is coded in Python using Apache Spark, so to run it you need to use: spark-submit similar_movies_example.py

First you need to download a MovieLens dataset from this site: http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ and put movies.dat and ratings.dat in a 'data' directory. I usually use the MovieLens 10M dataset for benchmarking, but you are free to use a bigger or smallest dataset. Please consider that you need a cluster to process a big dataset like the MovieLens 10M because the k-fold cross validation is very exhaustive and will be very slow using just a single worker.

I did this script because there are examples about how to do personalized recommendations based on user ratings, but I couldn't find examples about how to find similar items using the feature vectors obtained from the ALS algorithm.

Please note that in this example I'm using cosine similarity between feature vectors, but there are more ways to compute similarities e.g. by normalized cross correlation, Jaccard index or just euclidean distance.

In the script I test some movies to get their similarities and the result is written in a result.txt file.

This is an example of the output using the MovieLens 10M dataset:
